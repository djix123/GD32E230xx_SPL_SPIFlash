GD32E230xx_SPL_SPIFlash
=======================

Demonstration of connecting a GigaDevice GD32E230F8 (http://www.gd32mcu.com/en/download/0?kw=GD32E2) to a Winbond W25Q64FV using SPI and LittleFS for a filesystem

Implemented using:

i.   GD32F23x Firmware Library (Standard Peripheral Library - SPL)
ii.  PlatformIO GD32 - https://github.com/CommunityGD32Cores/platform-gd32
iii. LittleFS - https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs

Note:
    w25qxx.h / w25qxx.c borrowed from WeActTC's MSC_SPIFlash implementation for their BluePill-Plus board (https://github.com/WeActTC/BluePill-Plus/tree/master/SDK/STM32F103C8T6/HAL/MSC_SPIFlash)

    (The WeActTC boards are excellent - high quality with good support examples)
